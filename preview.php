        <p> How did the old man Simeon feel when he received the baby Jesus in the temple? <strong>(Luke 2:29)</strong>.<br><br>

        <strong>Very, very, fulfilled.</strong><br><br>

        He said <strong>“Now, Lord, you have kept your promise and you may let your servant go in peace”. </strong><br><br>

        His greatest aspiration was to see God’s promise- the savior of the world.<br><br>

        Now that he had seen Him, he was ready to rest in peace. <br><br>

        All of us are like Simeon, awaiting our dreams to come true.
         We are never fulfilled till that moment comes. 
         This is the moment of accomplishment and legacy shaping.
         The positive impact we create is the source of our joy.<br><br>

           The thirst for the moment of fulfillment makes us totally restless and unsettled.
            We can only quench this thirst when the moment finally sets in, unraveling the potential in us.
             At this instance, we are happy to play our unique role in the vineyard of God..<br><br>


             Many times we are distracted from our true calling or we deliberately keep off.
              We spend much time chasing the dreams of others, imagining that they are more appealing. <br><br>

              In the process we become empty, miserable and even sick. <br><br>

              Jonah tried to run away from his calling but failed miserably. 
              He only received his peace when he co-operated with God. <br><br>


              When Jeremiah thought of the heavy task ahead of him, he was tempted to behave like Jonah. However, the desire to do the will of God was burning like fire in his heart.
               This is why he said ….<strong>but when I say, “I will forget the Lord and no longer speak in His name,” then your message is like a fire burning within me. 
               I try to hold it in, but can no longer keep it back.</strong> <br><br>

               We find ourselves in similar situations. 
               The fire continues to burn in us until we accomplish our purpose. <br><br>

               There was a sense of great victory when Jesus addressed His disciples as he awaited His ascension to Heaven.
                Similarly, there was great fulfillment when Elijah awaited the chariot that took him to Heaven. <br><br>

                We all aspire to reach our moment of fulfillment where our legacy is shaped. <br><br>

                I don’t intend to compare myself with any of the great Bible personalities above. However, in my own ‘small’ way, 
                I feel excited and fulfilled to publish my book <strong> “JOURNEYING with the LIVING GOD”.</strong>
                 This book is a realization of my dream to share inspirations through personal experiences. <br><br>

                 I thank God that this dream has finally come true after many years of hardwork. <br><br>

                 The book <strong>‘JOURNEYING with the LIVING GOD’ </strong> seeks to inspire the readers in all aspects of their lives, 
                 namely social, spiritual, intellectual, national integration, to name but a few. <br><br>


                 The beauty of the book lies in its simplicity.
                  The author’s language and environment of upbringing are so simple that all of us will easily identify
                   with him. No wonder everyone including children, teenagers, senior youth, young professionals as well 
                    parents will find themselves being part of the story at one or more stages of the autobiography. <br><br>

                   <strong> What makes this autobiography so captivating?</strong> <br><br>

                   It is the dynamics of the author’s life which oscillates between extremes such as high and low moments, great success and great challenges, ordinary life and extraordinary interventions of the Almighty God, 
                   who walks with the author as a close friend. <br><br>

                   I invite you to read this book patiently to the end. The first part may be read continuously while the second part of the book requires reading in bits in order to derive maximum benefit.
                    For example, one can read a sub-section or two daily. <br><br>

                    You may want to share the book with as many people as possible in order to evangelize, inspire and encourage others, especially those facing challenges in life. 
                    In any case all of us do face challenges whether we speak out or not. <br><br>

                    Though the COVID – 19 pandemic has resulted to suffering which is greater than the narrated challenges, 
                    the book still becomes a great source of inspiration for all at this moment too. <br><br>

                    The physical book is available at a price of <strong> Ksh 500 </strong>per copy on order.
                     However, the e-book  is available at only <strong> Ksh 200 </strong> which will go a long way in promoting the work plus other upcoming titles. 
                     Please encourage those you share with to generously purchase the book.  
                     However, do not hesitate to share freely with family members especially the youth as well as anyone who may not afford to purchase. <br><br>


                     Welcome to journey with me. <br><br>

                     May God bless you abundantly as you read. <br><br>
